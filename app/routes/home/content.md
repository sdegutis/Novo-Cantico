*Finding a new harmony for web software from first principles.*

---

"Novo Cantico" is taken from the chorus of [Puer natus in Bethlehem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1k5YTmxIVc&t=2573s) and means "a new song".

Software and music are both rooted in principles and patterns, they are both an art and science.

This is more than an analogy; both reflect an invisible beauty, harmony, and order that's ever real, yet perceptible only to the mind.

Novo Cantico is a project that intends to find a new harmony in web software development, by starting from first principles.
