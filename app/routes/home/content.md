## The Philosophy of Novo Cantico

"Novo Cantico" is taken from the 13th century hymn, [Puer natus in Bethlehem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1k5YTmxIVc&t=2573s), and means "a new song". Software and music are both rooted in principles and patterns; both are arts and sciences; both reflect a beauty, harmony, and order that's visible only to the mind, but which have a very real effect on our lives.

Humanity develops the arts and sciences by distilling lessons learned from the past, and solidifying them into a new foundation; we all stand on the shoulders of giants. Novo Cantico is a project that aims to take lessons learned from the difficulties of modern web development, start from first principles, and find a new harmony.



## This site's three purposes

1. **Share what I made:** Around December 8, 2021, I began to rewrite my website using brand new techniques. I ended up with code I'm convinced is truly innovative, so I'm gradually open sourcing it in the form of this very website's source code, located in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdegutis/Novo-Cantico).

2. **Explain how it works:** Many of the concepts developed in Novo Cantico have very useful implications, but which are not always obvious. On this site I will explain how the new web software techniques of Novo Cantico work, and their various practical benefits.

3. **Offer my services:** I'm Steven, an independent software consultant with over a decade of experience. I'm currently available for hire, [email me](mailto:sbdegutis+novocantico@gmail.com) and let's talk. You can also sponsor me on GitHub to enable me to spend more time developing Novo Cantico.
