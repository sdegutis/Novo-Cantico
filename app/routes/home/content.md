# Novo Cantico

*Finding a new harmony for web software from first principles.*

---

"Novo Cantico" is taken from the chorus of [Puer natus in Bethlehem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1k5YTmxIVc&t=2573s) and means "a new song". Software and music are both rooted in principles and patterns; both are arts and sciences; both reflect a beauty, harmony, and order that's visible only to the mind, but which have a very real effect on our lives.

Humanity develops the arts and sciences by distilling lessons learned from the past, and solidifying them into a new foundation; we all stand on the shoulders of giants. Novo Cantico is a project that aims to take lessons learned from the difficulties of modern web development, start from first principles, and find a new harmony.


## The purpose of this site

I have three goals here:

1. **Share what I have:** In early December 2021, I began to rewrite my website using brand new techniques, trying to solve many problems with modern web development. I finally ended up with code I think will be valuable to the greater software community, so I'm gradually open sourcing it in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sdegutis/Novo-Cantico).

2. **Explain how it works:** Many of the concepts are so new or different that their implications are not always self-evident. And some of them are so counter to conventional wisdom that I am sure to receive critical feedback. I intend to explain and justify each of my technical decisions on this page, so that anyone can reuse the same principles and patterns, and feel confident in doing so.

3. **Offer my services:** My name is Steven Degutis, and I'm an independent software consultant with 10 years of professional experience, and another 10 of hobbyist software experience before that. I'm available for hire, [send me an email](mailto:sbdegutis+novocantico@gmail.com).
